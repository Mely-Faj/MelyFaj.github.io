        <p><div id ="paragraph"><span id="Humpfy-H">H</span>umpfy is my very first pet <span id="dragon">Dragon</span>.<br><br>

		 I was only 6 then and having a dragon is a huge responsibility.
	  	 I wanted fire breathing dragon as all of my friends had one; all of my friends with an older sibling.
		 Dad said I wasn't ready for such dragons. After much begging and banging,
 instead, Dad got me a water-spitting dragon and I hated it. The fact that it'd spit at me was humiliating.
 My friends were in awe. They said it was cool, both literally and in slang. <br><br>
            I named it "Humpfy" because at the sight of it I only gave one expression, "<span id="hmph">Hmph</span>!". <br><br>
            At night, I would leave it on its bed outside my room and when I'd hang between wake and sleep,
 it'd find a crack between my arms and cuddle in, and then I'll have no choice but to cuddle with it.
 It probably was fond of me because of all the fish and carrots I had to feed it. Even though I hated it,
 I can't let it starve. <br><br>
            In the morning, I'd wake up all soaked in its drool. Luckily, it's only mineral water and not
 stinky saliva filled with enzymes. Well, at least, it saved the time of having to take a shower in the
 morning when you always have to hurry for school. <br><br>
            As stated, having a dragon was a huge responsibility. I had to feed it 4 times a day, every
 day; scrub its scales every Friday, take it on long flights ( actually, just throwing a dronall 4 islands
 away for it to bring it back to me to throw it again for 4 to 8 times), clean it's litter box. I thought
 my mom was hoping that I'd give up on this dragon-keeping job and won't ask for one until I'm old with gray hairs.
 But was determined to show them that I can handle it and was responsible enough to pet a fire-breathing dragon. <br><br>
            A year was gone and I finally accomplished my goal. Mom sent Humpfy away to the maintainers and
 brought home a <span id="ad">shiny coal black scaled 70 degrees Celcius flame-breathing beach dragon</span>; the coolest dragon
 amongst the kids around my age. It was my dream dragon I had pictures of it from books, and magazines filling
 my diary cover. And I showed my over-jumpy joy to all. But I didn't feel truly content; I felt a hole
 inside my heart. Every night I tried to sleep cuddling with my "<span id="hether">Hether</span>" but didn't feel comfy. Every day,
 I rode Hether to school, leaving it occupied with burnt marshmallows in class. <br><br>
            Days went by and I missed Humpfy more and more. Comparisons rouse in my head on its own.
 Hether doesn't hover up and down like Humpfy at the sight of me rather rolls on the ground and puts
 everything on fire at the sight of charcoal like burnt marshmallow. Hether doesn't save me time on
 busy mornings rather makes me sleep in often from being awake too many times at night to find a
 comfy position as it sleeps on my bed spiraled up.<br><br>
            As I couldn't bear it any longer, I begged mom and dad to bring back Humpfy. <br><br>
            On July, 30, we all went over to the maintainers and rode Humpfy home. <br><br>
            Now Hether is being taken care of by my mom. She says she has grown fond of it.
 But I think the real reason mom wants to keep it is probably because it eats all those burnt
 marshmallows with such an appetite.</div>

        <p><div id ="paragraph"><span id="today-t">T</span>oday I was playing long flights with Humphy with his favourite and one and only Dronall.
 As I was throwing it, from out of nowhere Hether jumped on my back and I lost track on my GPS, and before I knew it , That drone ball fell into the deep sea of the southern isles.

 Wondering How I will retrieve it. <br><br>

        Should I rent a deep sea frog?</div></p>
